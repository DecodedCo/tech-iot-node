# tech-iot-node
Arduino IoT boilerplate using Node.js and Johnny-Five

This uses [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) with [Johnny-Five](http://johnny-five.io/api) for programming a device (e.g. Arduino) running the [Firmata Protocol](https://github.com/firmata/protocol).

## Laptop Setup

1. Install `node.js` from https://nodejs.org/
2. Clone or Download this repository to your computer
3. Navigate to the project directory using your Terminal
4. Run `npm install` to install dependencies

## Arduino setup

Firmata has already been installed on your Arduino, so just supply it power and you are good to go!

## Development

1. Run `npm start` in your terminal
2. Open the project in a code editor. We recommend [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).
3. Update your code and enjoy creating an IoT device!
